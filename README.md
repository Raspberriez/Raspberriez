## Yumemi

- Add writing section
- Add customisable timeout to completions prefs
- Add customisable memory limit to completions prefs
- Add image-to-image and inpainting [(edits and variations)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create-edit)
- Add local hard-limit of 50 images / minute so we don't get rate-limited
- Add antiprompt option to images
- Maybe pass all prompts through moderation? Or just tell people not to fuck with the system so I don't get banned
